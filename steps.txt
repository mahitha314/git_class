Set Up Your Local Repository 
If you haven't already initialized your project folder, do so now.
Navigate to your project folder:
cd path/to/your/project
Initialize Git:
git init -b main
(Note: Using -b main ensures your default branch is named "main" instead of the older "master".) 
2. Connect to GitHub
You must link your local folder to a remote repository on GitHub. 
Create a new repository on GitHub.com.
3. Stage and Commit Your File
Stage the file:
To stage a specific file: git add filename.ext
To stage all files in the folder: git add .
Commit the changes:
git commit -m "Add your descriptive message here" 
Push to GitHub
Push the file:
git push -u origin main
(The -u flag sets the upstream, so in the future, you only need to type git push.)
